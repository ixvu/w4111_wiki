# Introduction to W4111

*(This is an example sketch of scribe notes for lecture 1.  Start with a paragraph summary of the topic, along with a bullet list of the main sub-topics. )*

The goal of this class is two-fold.  First, to introduce you to core database concepts (e.g., data modeling, logical design, SQL) so that you too can build a billion dollar application.  Second, to teach enough about database engine internals (e.g., physical database design, query optimization,     transaction processing) so you have a good sense of why queries may be running slowly/incorrectly.

The lecture goes over four ideas

* Why data is popular
* What application areas is data used in
* What is data and a database?
* What does this course cover?
* A short overview of a database system and its components.


## Why Data is Popular?

Data's popularity is based on two factors: the ability to generate data, and the ability to store data cheaply.

Storing data was historically expensive because it required manual work in order to write, chisel, carve data into physical objects.  The computer era drove down data storage costs exponentially--a one terabyte drive costs less than a nice dinner today.  

Generating data was historically expensive because of manual work.  Even today, the vast majority of data (by volume) is not generated by humans.  Back of the envelope calculation shows that number of credit card transactions per day is XXX and the volume of tweets per day is YYY.  If every human were to type continuously, it would only generate ZZZ per day. Thus data is primarily generated automatically.
