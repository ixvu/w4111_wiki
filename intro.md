# Introduction to W4111

(This is an example sketch of scribe notes for lecture 1.  Start with a paragraph summary of the topic, along with a bullet list of the main sub-topics. )

The goal of this class is two-fold.  First, to introduce you to core database concepts (e.g., data modeling, logical design, SQL) so that you too can build a billion dollar application.  Second, to teach enough about database engine internals (e.g., physical database design, query optimization,     transaction processing) so you have a good sense of why queries may be running slowly/incorrectly.

The lecture goes over four ideas

* Why data is popular
* What application areas is data used in
* What is data and a database?
* What does this course cover?
* A short overview of a database system and its components.


## Why Data is Popular?

Data's popularity is based on two factors: the ability to generate data, and the ability to store data cheaply.
