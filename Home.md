# W4111 Scribe Notes

The goal of these scribe notes is to eventually create a document that can replace and surpass the expensive textbook.  These notes are meant to supplement the lecture slides, which do not include detailed information nor full examples, and address the issue that the same questions are repeatedly asked on Piazza.

## How to Contribute

There are three ways to contribute, 

## Primary Scribe Content

Your scribe notes should cover all the material covered in the lecture, as well as relevant references or examples for the covered material.  Your notes should be understandable to someone who has not been to the lecture.  In most cases, you should write in complete sentences so that the text can be easily followed.  Use numbered sections, subsections, etc. to organize the material hierarchically and with _meaningful_ titles.  Try to describe the motivation of the topic, the technical difficulties, solution ideas, solutions that don't work, and examples.

You may use the lecture slides as a reference when writing the scribe notes.  You are expected to "fill in the gaps" by fleshing out the bullet points in the slides, going into more detail, and including examples as well as solutions to questions brought up in lecture or on piazza.

## Format

Write your notes using LaTeX, with figures in Encapsulated PostScript (generated from xfig or Adobe Illustrator or whatever you want). Start from the provided scribe template, which sets the style.

## Timing

Scribe notes should be completed and shared with the course staff within 2 days of the lecture.  The course staff will send you comments or schedule a meeting to go over the text.  The staff will make suggestions, you will make a second pass, and submit it.   The goal will be to get the notes out by one week after the corresponding class.
