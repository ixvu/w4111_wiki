# W4111 Scribe Notes

The goal of these scribe notes is to eventually create a document that can replace and surpass the expensive textbook.  These notes are meant to supplement the lecture slides, which do not include detailed information nor full examples, and address the issue that the same questions are repeatedly asked on Piazza.

## How to Contribute

There are multiple ways to contribute: 

* sign up below to be the primary scribe for a specific lecture 
* add constructive comments and edits to existing pages
* add relevant examples (say, on instabase if it is executable) based on discussion in class or on piazza
* add figures to clarify concepts
* add relevant references

**If you contribute, add your name in the [[Contributors|contributors]] page along with a _very_ short description of the contribution**

### Sign Up

Reserve the lecture that you will scribe for by adding your github username next to the lecture number.  **Do not remove an existing username**  Working together is encouraged, *particularly* if you are scribing for the same topic..

### Credit

Extra credit may be earned for contributing to the scribe notes.  The credit will be assigned subjectively based on the quality and value of the written notes, and the amount that you contribute.  The most important aspect is that the edits are concrete contributions.  Some rough guidelines are the following:

* >5%: above and beyond what is listed below.
* 3-5%: write and edit the scribe contents for one lecture.  Of the quality that can be publicly shared and helpful to classmates.
* <2%: adding new examples, fleshing out ambiguous text, and otherwise improvements on the order of paragraphs.
* <1%: minor edits (e.g., typos) on the order of sentences
* <0%: NOOP edits or those that introduce more errors/confusion than they remove.



## Primary Scribe Content

Your scribe notes should cover all the material covered in the lecture, as well as relevant references or examples for the covered material.  Your notes should be understandable to someone who has not been to the lecture.  In most cases, you should write in complete sentences so that the text can be easily followed.  Use numbered sections, subsections, etc. to organize the material hierarchically and with _meaningful_ titles.  Try to describe the motivation of the topic, the technical difficulties, solution ideas, solutions that don't work, and examples.

You may use the lecture slides as a reference when writing the scribe notes.  You are expected to "fill in the gaps" by fleshing out the bullet points in the slides, going into more detail, and including examples as well as solutions to questions brought up in lecture or on piazza.

## Format

Write your notes using Markdown with proper heading, lists, and code blocks.

## Timing

Scribe notes should be completed and shared with the course staff within 2 days of the lecture.  We encourage scribes to take notes directly in markdown in class and refine it after class.  The course staff will send you comments or schedule a meeting to go over the text.  The staff will make suggestions, you will make a second pass, and submit it.   The goal will be to get the notes out within one week after the corresponding class.
