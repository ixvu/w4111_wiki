The two subsets of SQL language:
- Data Definition Language (DDL): All the statements in order to create or define schema.
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): Get data into the database, modify and fetch data.

SQL is an extension of relational algebra, it extends in many ways: 
- Multi-sets: results of SQL statement can contain duplicates
- NULLs
- Aggregates
